Users will be able to sign up and log in after entering their basic information. They will be able to add a new workout, which will have a schema for 4 climbing-related benchmarks to quanify the user's level of strength. These benchmarks will give the user an output of what climbing grade their benchmarks suggest they can climb. 

Coaches will be authorized to view all of their athletes' workouts. They can view changes and trends in athlete benchmarks to help formulate a training plan for each athlete.

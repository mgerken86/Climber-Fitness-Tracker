<h1>Hello, Coach {{user.firstName}} {{user.lastName}}</h1>

<div class="directions-container">
    <section>
        <p>Are you a climbing coach or personal trainer who's constantly asked by your athletes, "What grade do you
            think I'm strong enough to climb?"</p>

        <p>Welcome to <span class="blue">COACHES CORNER</span>, a quick and easy way to convert the score of 4 exercises
            into a suggested climbing grade!</p>
        <p>Each workout you add to an athlete updates his/her current climbing grade fitness, and any of your athletes'
            workouts will
            have the potential to make it on the Top 10 global Leaderboard. You are the only one with access to
            add/edit/delete your athletes and their workouts.</p>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <p>Add a new athlete that you want to test through the <span class="blue">My Athletes</span> link.
            Click on <span class="blue">Add a New Climber</span> and fill out your athlete's information.
            You will now be able to click on their name and add a new workout for them</p>

    <h4>How Will Coaches Corner Help Me?</h4>
    <p><span class="blue">Coaches Corner</span> will help you track your athletes' progress and their trends in physical
        abilities. Any outlier scores in 1 of the 4 exercises will help you create a training plan accordingly.</p>
    <p>If an athlete is struggling to climb grades lower than their suggested <span class="blue">Coaches Corner</span>
        grade, they will need to focus more on training technique / their mental game</p>
    <p>Inversely, if an athlete is succeeding on grades higher than their suggested <span class="blue">Coaches
            Corner</span> grade, their technique / head-game is solid, and they need to focus on training strength.</p>
    <p>Finally, are you curious about tracking your own strength + progress? Add yourself as your own athlete and train
        away!!</p>

<h1>Hello, Coach {{user.firstName}} {{user.lastName}}</h1>

<div class="directions-container">
    <section>
        <p>Are you a climbing coach or personal trainer who's constantly asked by your athletes, <span class="blue">"What grade am I strong enough to climb?"</span></p>

        <p>Welcome to <span class="blue">COACHES CORNER</span>, a quick and easy way to convert the score of 4 exercises
            into a suggested climbing grade! You will also be provided a name and picture of a climb of that grade to keep your athlete motivation!</p>
        <p>Each workout you add to an athlete updates his/her current climbing grade fitness, and any of your athletes'
            workouts will
            have the potential to make it to the <span class="blue">Top 10 global Leaderboard</span>. You are the only one who can add/edit/delete your athletes and their workouts.</p>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <p>Add a new athlete that you want to test through the <span class="blue">My Athletes</span> link.
            Click on <span class="blue">Add a New Climber</span> and fill out your athlete's information.
            You will now be able to click on their name and add a new workout for them. Once the workout is added, you can see the specifics of that workout and a rock-climb of the grade of that workout's score.</p>

    <h4>How Will Coaches Corner Help Me?</h4>
    <p><span class="blue">Coaches Corner</span> will help you track your athletes' progress and their trends in physical
        abilities. Any outlier scores in 1 of the 4 exercises will help you create a training plan accordingly.</p>
    <p>If an athlete is struggling to climb grades lower than their suggested <span class="blue">Coaches Corner</span>
        grade, they will need to focus more on training technique / their mental game</p>
    <p>Inversely, if an athlete is succeeding on grades higher than their suggested <span class="blue">Coaches
            Corner</span> grade, their technique / head-game is solid, and they need to focus on training strength.</p>
    <p>Finally, are you curious about tracking your own strength + progress? Add yourself as your own athlete and train
        away!!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Max Finger Strength : <span class="blue">10 points available</span></li>

        <h4>Max Finger Strength:</h4>
        <p><span class="blue">For this test, the goal is to hang for approximately five seconds on a 20-millimeter edge.</span></p>
        <p>The score breakdown is as follows:</p>

        <h4>Core Strength:</h4>
        <p><span class="blue">For this test, the score breaks down by exercise.</span></p>

            <li>Front lever (perfect form) for 7-10 points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The scoring is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <span class="blue">L-sit (knees bent):</span>
            <li><span class="blue">1 point</span>= 10 seconds</li>
            <li><span class="blue">2 points</span>= 20 seconds</li>
            <li><span class="blue">3 points</span>= 30 seconds</li>
            <span class="blue">L-sit (legs extended):</span>

            <li><span class="blue">5 points</span>= 15 seconds</li>
            <li><span class="blue">6 points</span>= 20 seconds</li>
            <span class="blue">Front Lever:</span>
            <li><span class="blue">7 points</span>= 5 seconds</li>
            <li><span class="blue">8 points</span>= 10 seconds</li>
